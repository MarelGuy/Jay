# Updates

## 2022-02-01
The code needs a refactor, I'll be working on it now.
Also, I couldn't work on the code for a while, I read a book about rust to get a lil bit more knowledge.

Things are getting delayed a lot, school is pretty much killing my time.
I'm not abandoning the project, I will start to work on it seriously in the summer.
I will still be working on the code, but much much less than before.

## 2022-03-03
Basically resetting the project. I did my experiments and now I think I'm ready to start working on the code again.

## 2022-04-03
Today I worked all day on the code (of course I took some rest too).
I'm still working on making the parser, but the base features of the lexer is working.
I hope I can finish the parser in the next days, still I don't have much time.
