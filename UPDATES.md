# Updates

## 2022-02-01

The code needs a refactor, I'll be working on it now.
Also, I couldn't work on the code for a while, I read a book about rust to get a lil bit more knowledge.

Things are getting delayed a lot, school is pretty much killing my time.
I'm not abandoning the project, I will start to work on it seriously in the summer.
I will still be working on the code, but much much less than before.

## 2022-03-03

Basically resetting the project. I did my experiments and now I think I'm ready to start working on the code again.

Today I worked all day on the code (of course I took some rest too).
I'm still working on making the parser, but the base features of the lexer is working.
I hope I can finish the parser in the next days, still I don't have much time.

## 2022-05-15: part 1

A friend of mine found a bug:
if we write in input: 1+1, we will get [integer, integer] as tokens.
if we write in input: 1 + 1 or 1 +1 we will get [integer, plus, integer] as tokens.
i think that it's intuitive what we want to happen, doesn't matter how many spaces we need to get [integer, plus, integer] as tokens.
I'm also currently working on the bug, but since I can't always work on it, idk when it'll be fixed.

## 2022-05-15: part 2

The bug is fixed, I'll be working on the parser in the next days.

Note: Everytime I commit something, it is just when I'm in school and lessions are not important.
