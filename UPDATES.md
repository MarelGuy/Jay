The code needs a refactor, I'll be working on it now.
Also, i couldn't work on the code for a while, i read a book about rust to get a lil bit more knowledge.

Things are getting delayed a lot, school is pretty much killing my time.
I'm not abandoning the project, i will start to work on it seriously in the summer.
I will still be working on the code, but much much less than before.

Basically resetting the project. I did my experiments and now i think i'm ready to start working on the code.
