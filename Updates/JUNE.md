Yesterday I changed some things, i'm not really sure if it's correct, i'll stick with it until it doesn't give me problems.

Yeah Devil May Cry 5 is a good game. I'll resume my work on the project.  
In these days tho, I worked on the syntax of Jay too, I'll probably change something else in the future.

So, some time ago I started Boxing, so I can't really concentrate only on the project, I'm still working sometimes, but less than before.
Also, we got some things fixed, but it's nothing much, now I just need to fix the bug and then I can continue with the project.
