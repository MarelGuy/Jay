The code needs a refactor, I'll be working on it now.  
Also, I couldn't work on the code for a while, I read a book about rust to get a lil bit more knowledge.

Things are getting delayed a lot, school is pretty much killing my time.  
I'm not abandoning the project, I will start to work on it seriously in the summer.  
I will still be working on the code, but much much less than before.
