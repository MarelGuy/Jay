Deleting the project.  
Well, yeah I was just joking, but it kind of happened.  
Yesterday I was working on the code and I accidentally hit some times the [canc] key while not in the file, so vscode chose to delete everything.  
Right now, I'm basically redoing everything I did yesterday, but I'm not sure it'll be done for today.  
Also, just so you know, when I accidentally deleted everything, I banged my head against the wall, I felt refreshed after that.

I'm working on a school project, that's why I wasn't able to do anything for these days, I'll start working on Jay again from the 2022-04-04.

I did not forget about Jay, I'm not in my best period of my life, sorry if updates and commits will be missing for a while.
