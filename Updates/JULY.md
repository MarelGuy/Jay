Things are weird, I'm on vacation and I'm going to the gym, it's pretty hard to continue with
the project, I'll go on though, I can't abandon this whole thing, I'll get back home in
4 days, after that, I'll try to be more consistent. Sorry for that.

We are at it again, today I fixed some minor bugs and added return and return_if to the language.  
I'm going another time "on vacation", from 2022-07-31 to 2022-08-09, I'll still try to update the code.  
Sorry for being so inconsistent.
