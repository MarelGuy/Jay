God it's four months.  
Ok so, I may (pun not intended) have Covid-19, but I'm not sure.  
I'm not feeling well, so for now I'm not going to work on the project.  
When I'll feel better I'll start working on it again.  
It's kind of unfortunate tho, when i started working on the project again, i felt motivated after a long time.  
Wish me luck for both my health and my project.  
See ya.

Here I am again! Not only I feel better but I've fixed some bugs and added some features.  
Things will go kind of downhill from here.
