God it's four months.  
Ok so, I may (pun not intended) have Covid-19, but I'm not sure.  
I'm not feeling well, so for now I'm not going to work on the project.  
When I'll feel better I'll start working on it again.  
It's kind of unfortunate tho, when I started working on the project again, I felt motivated after a long time.  
Wish me luck for both my health and my project.  
See ya.

## 2022-05-04

Here I am again! Not only I feel better but I've fixed some bugs and added some features.  
Things will go kind of downhill from here.

## 2022-05-05

Today I'll be working on parsing variables and constants, the bug about the compiler will be fixed after the
the whole language can be parsed correctly with the interpreter.

## 2022-05-06

Here we are again.  
Today I'll work on the if else statement.  
Also, I'm using "Error" in a lot of places, that means that I need to make an
actual error handler for that thing.

Hey there!  
Today I fixed everything I could possibliy fix.  
I'm glad to see that everything is working fine, I never felt so happy like this just from a project.  
This isn't over yet, but this fix is the turning point of the project.  
Now I'll be working on some more features, like loops.

## 2022-05-09

Well, yeah I didn't work on the loops because I found some bugs, nothing much tho, I'll start working on the loops now.

## 2022-05-11

Hey there, today I finished the for loop and the while loop. They are kind of a mix between some syntaxes, I might change them.  
I also need to change the bnf, it's not accurate anymore. But we have some news today.  
My idea was to have a JIT interpreter and a compiler, but seeing how things are going, I think that it's not necessary.  
What I mean is: we don't need an interpreter, we can just use the compiler to compile the code and run it.  
There one thing tho, the interpreter won't be scrapped, instead it'll be an idea for the future.  
Also, since the parser is getting some good pacing, I must start a sub-project with LLVM-IR.  
The main project will be halted, and I'll update only a few bugs while working on this sub-project.  
It's a calculator, and I'll compile basic expressions, that includes parsing and lexing of course.  
We'll be using Inkwell, a rust-llvm wrapper, wish me luck!

## 2022-05-17

Things are bad, after some research inkwell is not production ready, which means that if we use inkwell, the language won't be production ready.  
I was now thinking about wrapping my code in c, using a self-made wrapper.  
I'll need to test, this wrapper will also be closed source (probably, I don't know), now that I have my plans clear, I'll revert the project to my working previous state.

## 2022-05-18

Hey there! Today after working on something on the parser, I noticed that testing code without syntax highlighting is.. bad.  
I'm starting a project following the vscode guide, which will be a full language support for the language.

## 2022-05-23

I didn't really work on much sadly, since school is finishing I can't really only work on the code.  
I'm still gonna push a buggy code, I'll fix it in the next hours while in school.

## 2022-05-24

Nice, I fixed everything. I got a problem though, my current todo list isn't really great, and I can't keep track of
the things I'm doing rn, I'll create another one just for the sake of it (I'll probably do a trello, maybe).

## 2022-05-29

Yeah... I didn't do anything in some days, Ace Combat 7 is a great game though.  
But jokes off, I really can't do much right now, I'm still in school, when the tests are done, I'll start working on the project again.
