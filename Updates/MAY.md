God it's four months.  
Ok so, I may (pun not intended) have Covid-19, but I'm not sure.  
I'm not feeling well, so for now I'm not going to work on the project.  
When I'll feel better I'll start working on it again.  
It's kind of unfortunate tho, when i started working on the project again, i felt motivated after a long time.  
Wish me luck for both my health and my project.  
See ya.

Here I am again! Not only I feel better but I've fixed some bugs and added some features.  
Things will go kind of downhill from here.

Today I'll be working on parsing variables and constants, the bug about the compiler will be fixed after the
the whole language can be parsed correctly with the interpreter.

Here we are again.  
Today I'll work on the if else statement.  
Also, I'm using "Error" in a lot of places, that means that I need to make an
actual error handler for that thing.

Hey there!  
Today I fixed everything i could possibliy fix.  
I'm glad to see that everything is working fine, I never felt so happy like this just from a project.  
This isn't over yet, but this fix is the turning point of the project.  
Now I'll be working on some more features, like loops.

Well, yeah I didn't work on the loops because I found some bugs, nothing much tho, I'll start working on the loops now.
