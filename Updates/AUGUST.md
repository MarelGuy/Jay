Yesterday I anticipated an update, today I'll be (probably) adding both import and export, still  
I'll probably push the changes tomorrow, basically after testing and making sure everything works.  
Also, I'll be taking a train for Milan, I hope to be finished with everything before arriving.  
*Later*  
It was easier than expected, I'll be working on arrays now.
*Even later-er*
I'm done, well... Kinda.  
The dot notation isn't really something I can do now, I'll add it later when I'm sure that the parser   is 100% working, now it's time to get into error handling, I'll work in it in the train, I'll have 4   (more or less) hours.
