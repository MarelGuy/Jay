## About Jay

- ### What is Jay?

    Jay is a new programming language that aims to creating a new, simple and straight fowrard programming language. Right now, Jay is in development and it is NOT ready to use.

- ### Why Jay?

    I mean, why not? The project is in early stages and eveyrone is welcome to contribute. Even if you are not a programmer, you can still contribute by giving ideas on logos, styles and other things that are not code related.

- ### How Jay works?

    The first Jay compiler will be written in Rust, then, when the language is ready to use, it wil be ported to Jay. The grammar and syntax is still in development, so you are free to contribute on syntax ideas too.
