# Jay

## About Jay
Jay is a new programming language that aims to create a new, simple, and straightforward programming experience. Currently, Jay is under development and is not ready for use.

## Why Jay?
Why not? The project is in its early stages, and everyone is welcome to contribute. Even if you're not a programmer, you can still make a valuable contribution by providing ideas for logos, styles, and other non-code-related aspects.

## How Jay Works?
The initial Jay compiler will be written in Rust. Once the language is ready for use, it will be ported to Jay itself. The grammar and syntax are still being developed, so you're free to contribute ideas regarding the syntax as well.
